V1-7:

The grand mean is the weighted average of all the $y_j$ taken with the weights $n_j$. Using the values given in V-4, we get:

Grand Mean = $\frac{1}{33} * (12 * 23.75 + 12 + 14.083 + 9 * 15.778) = 595.998/33 = 18.06054$

Therefore, we have shown that the Grand Mean is equal to the required value.


V2-8:

```{r}
2 * pt(-0.7344, 30)
```

Since this p-value is considerably high, we would reject the null hypothesis at many of the conventional significance levels.
