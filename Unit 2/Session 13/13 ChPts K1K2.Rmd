# Intro to Propatation of Error/Delta Method

We're going to motivate propagation of error and the delta method by comparing the distribution of outputs of $g(x) = x^2$ to those of the linearization of $g(x)$ about x = 1, $\hat g(x) = 1^2 + 2(1)(x-1) = 2x-1$.

1.  Simulate 1000 uniformly distributed variables between 0.9 and 1.1 and apply $g(x)$ and $\hat g(x)$.  How do their means compare?  How do their standard deviations compare?

In this case, the means and the standard deviations are quite similar. We can see that the mean is the same up to 2 decimal points. In the case of the standard deviation, the value is a bit high as compared to the standard deviations that we get using rnorm. These too are similar upto atleast 3 decimal points.

```{r uniform}
x <- runif(1000,0.9,1.1)
g_nonlinear <- x^2  # type in g(x) here
g_linear <-  2*x-1 # type in hat g(x) here
mean(g_nonlinear); mean(g_linear)
sd(g_nonlinear); sd(g_linear)
```

2.  Simulate 1000 normally distributed variables with a mean of 1 and a SD of $0.2/\sqrt{25\cdot 12}$ and apply $g(x)$ and $\hat g(x)$.  How do their means compare?  How do their standard deviations compare?

Over here, we see that the means are much closer to each other compared to the previous example. They reach up to 4 digits after the decimal point of similarity. Here, we can also observe that the standard deviation is a magnitude of 10 lower when compared to the standard deviation in the previous example. Also, their values are similar upto 5 digits after the decimal point.

```{r normal}
x <- rnorm(1000,1,0.2/sqrt(40*12))
g_nonlinear <- x^2  # type in g(x) here
g_linear <-  2*x-1 # type in hat g(x) here
mean(g_nonlinear); mean(g_linear)
sd(g_nonlinear); sd(g_linear)
```
